My solutions to (Advent Of Code 2024)[https://adventofcode.com/].

#### Day 1
Day one was fairly straightforward and quick but fun nonetheless. Elixir seems to fit these sort of problems really well!

#### Day 2
Did it with javascript to make some people cry. F*** it we ball.

#### Day 7
A brute force solution made using Elixir. This was actually the first puzzle I solved this year and it was a fun one.
